My dotfiles

This is currently a work in progress and does not currently function fully.

For now this includes some basic tmux config and the beginnings of an install
script. Eventually I hope to be able to provision a mac with a single command.

I intend to document every step heavily so even people new to the command line
are able to understand what's going on (and more to the point myself when 
trying to edit any of this later)
